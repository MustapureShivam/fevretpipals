        <h2>Jawan Shubham Mustapure</h2>

        <p>Palam (Parbhani): Soldier Shubham Mustapure, who was martyred in firing by Pakistani soldiers, joined the Indian Army last year. As his dream of joining the army came true,
             Shubham had come to the village on leave. Have to say.</p>
             <br>
             <h2>village</h2>
             <p>A 21-year-old soldier, Shubham Suryakant Mustapure, a resident of Konerwadi in Palam taluka, was martyred today in Pakistan Army firing. The financial condition of
                 Jawan Mustapure's family is precarious. His father earns his living by doing tailor work and farming in the village. His family owns 2 acres of dry land of 
                  He has two younger siblings, both of whom are studying in Gangakhed. Shubham's primary education was done in Chattori, 10th in Ahmedpur and 11th and 12th in Palam.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>country service</h2>
                  <p>Shubham cherished the dream of joining the Indian Army and serving the country. For this, he also underwent pre-recruitment training in a private academy at Nanded to 
                    join the army. Apart from this, he used to do regular exercises in the village and practice for field tests. That is why Shubham was selected in the Indian Army 
                    in the recruitment process held in Aurangabad in September 2017. After training in Bangalore for 11 months, jawan Shubham came to Konerwadi after taking a month 
                    leave from 24th December 2017 to 24th January 2018. This was his last meeting with his family. During this holiday, as his dream of joining the army came true, 
                    jawan Shubham took a Maroti rota program in the village and served the village food.</p>
